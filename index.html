            <h2>About me</h2>
          
            <p>
              I'm <span>Rakesh Kamma</span>, hailing from the vibrant city of Hyderabad, where dreams take shape. I embarked on my academic journey in Computer Science at <span>Amrita University</span> in Bangalore, graduating in June 2021 with not just satisfactory grades, but also a treasure trove of enduring memories and lifelong friendships.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              My professional voyage commenced just before graduation when I joined <span>Rockwell Automation (Knowledge Lens)</span> as a Data Analyst. Over the course of a year, I honed my analytical prowess and cultivated a thirst for knowledge and growth that led me to the picturesque town of DeKalb, Illinois, USA. 
            </p>
            <p>

            Here, I embarked on a path of academic enrichment, pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at <span>NIU</span>, set to culminate in December 2023.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              During my tenure as a graduate student, I donned the role of a Research Assistant, contributing significantly to the evolution of Python scripting for Pydeck Visualizations. My journey then led me to the intriguing realm of Knowledge Graphs within the US Tax Code at NIU. Here, I played a pivotal role in constructing graphs that unlock invaluable insights.
            </p>
            <p></p> My journey continued with a stint as a Pricing Analyst for the innovative startup <span>Aatlas</span>, where I meticulously crafted pricing models, notably the Van-Westendrop's Model. 
            </p>
          
            <p>
              Beyond the confines of my laptop, you might spot me on the badminton court, engaging in my passion for the sport, or immersing myself in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
